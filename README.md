A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

That's an excellent question. The approach of switching widgets versus using navigation pushes each has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on your specific use case. Let's break this down:
Switching Widgets (as in the example provided):
Pros:

Maintains a single navigation stack, which is simpler for basic apps.
Preserves state of all pages, as they remain in the widget tree.
Faster transitions between pages, as widgets are already built.
Works well with bottom navigation patterns, matching user expectations for this UI pattern.

Cons:

Can use more memory, as all pages are kept in memory simultaneously.
Doesn't provide a back button or navigation history out of the box.
May not be suitable for apps with deep navigation hierarchies.

Using Navigation Push:
Pros:

Follows the platform's navigation paradigm more closely.
Provides navigation history and back button functionality.
Can be more memory-efficient as pages can be disposed when not in use.
Better for apps with complex navigation flows or deep hierarchies.

Cons:

Can lead to a complex navigation stack if not managed properly.
May not preserve state by default when navigating back (though this can be managed).
Slightly slower transitions as new pages need to be built.

In general:

For apps with a simple structure and a bottom navigation bar, switching widgets (as in the example) is often a good practice. It matches user expectations for this UI pattern and provides smooth transitions.
For more complex apps with multiple levels of navigation, using navigation pushes is usually better. It allows for more flexible navigation patterns and better aligns with platform conventions.
Some apps use a hybrid approach: switching for main tabs, but using pushes for deeper navigation within each tab.

Best practices:

Match your navigation strategy to your app's complexity and user expectations.
Consider memory usage, especially if your pages are heavy.
Ensure your chosen method allows for proper state management.
If using widget switching, consider implementing a custom back button handler if needed.
If using navigation pushes with a bottom bar, ensure the navigation stack is properly cleared when switching tabs to avoid unexpected back button behavior.

In the context of the example with just two main pages controlled by a bottom navigation bar, switching widgets is a perfectly acceptable and often preferred approach. However, as your app grows in complexity, you might need to reevaluate this strategy.
Would you like me to elaborate on how to implement either of these approaches in more detail?
